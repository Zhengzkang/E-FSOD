# Few-Shot Object Detection via Efficient Fine-tune Approach and Contrastive learning
We combine the last two papers to introduce efficient fine-tuning, weight initialization, and contrastive learning to jointly train few-shot detectors. The Detectron2 architecture is mainly used, which is adopted by many SOTA FSOD methods, our aim is to communicate and learn with everyone. Our paper has achieved good performance on VOC and is currently under review.

# Installation
## Requirements
Linux with Python >= 3.6

PyTorch >= 1.4

torchvision that matches the PyTorch installation

CUDA 9.2, 10.0, 10.1, 10.2, 11.0

GCC >= 4.9


## install pytorch and cuda here https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/
```
pip install torch==1.10.0+cu102 torchvision==0.11.0+cu102 torchaudio==0.10.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```

## download our repo and install detectron2
```
cd E-FSOD && pip install -e .
```

## install pycocotools, lvis-api and tensorboard
```
pip install cython; pip install 'git+https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git#subdirectory=PythonAPI'
pip install git+https://github.com/lvis-dataset/lvis-api.git
pip install tensorboard
```
To __rebuild__ detectron2, `rm -rf build/ **/*.so` then `pip install -e .`.
You often need to rebuild detectron2 after reinstalling PyTorch.

## Data Prepare
###  For VOC
We use the train/val sets of PASCAL VOC 2007+2012 for training and the test set of PASCAL VOC 2007 for evaluation. We randomly split the 20 object classes into 15 base classes and 5 novel classes, and we consider 3 random splits.(soft link in datasets/VOC)
The shots in the datasets/vocsplit directory are the same shots used by previous works(TFA). run voc_create_base.py and voc_create_standard.py (note path of data)

### For custom 
First, you should build your dataset for FSOD;

Second, You have to modify the path and category of the dataset in "detectron2/data/datasets/pascal_voc.py" and "register_all_pascal_voc in detectron2/data/datasets/builtin.py".

Before tarining, you should set up good hypers and number of classes in config/*.yaml. 

## Training, Evaluation & Visualize

Base training

To train a model, run
```
python tools/train_net.py --num-gpus 4 \
        --config-file configs/VOC/faster_rcnn_R_101_FPN_base.yaml
```

Fine-tune

Using weight trained by Base training modified in configs/VOC/faster_rcnn_R_101_FPN_ours_split1_10shot.yaml
```
python tools/train_net.py --num-gpus 4 \
        --config-file configs/VOC/faster_rcnn_R_101_FPN_ours_split1_10shot.yaml
```
modify 10shot to 1,2,3,5,10 for all setting.


To evaluate the trained models, run
```
python tools/test_net.py --num-gpus 4 \
        --config-file configs/VOC/faster_rcnn_R_101_FPN_ours_10shot.yaml \
        --eval-only
```
To Vis the image/video/camer
```
python demo.py --config-file configs/VOC/faster_rcnn_R_101_FPN_ours_10shot.yaml \
               --input/--video-input/--webcam file \
	       --output outpu_dir
```
